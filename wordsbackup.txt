Then
after
fourteen
years
I
went
up
again
to
Jerusalem
with
Barnabas
and
also
took
Titus
with
me
And
I
went
up
by
revelation
and
communicated
to
them
that
gospel
which
I
preach
among
the
Gentiles
but
privately
to
those
who
were
of
reputation
lest
by
any
means
I
might
run
or
had
run
in
vain
Yet
not
even
Titus
who
was
with
me
being
a
Greek
was
compelled
to
be
circumcised
And
this
occurred
because
of
false
brethren
secretly
brought
in
came
in
by
stealth
to
spy
out
our
liberty
which
we
have
in
Christ
Jesus
that
they
might
bring
us
into
bondage
to
whom
we
did
not
yield
submission
even
for
an
hour
that
the
truth
of
the
gospel
might
continue
with
you
But
from
those
who
seemed
to
be
somethingwhatever
they
were
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
God
shows
personal
favoritism
to
no
manfor
those
who
seemed
to
be
something
added
nothing
to
me
But
on
the
contrary
when
they
saw
that
the
gospel
for
the
uncircumcised
had
been
committed
to
me
as
the
gospel
for
the
circumcised
was
to
Peter
He
who
worked
effectively
in
Peter
for
the
apostleship
to
the
circumcised
also
worked
effectively
in
me
toward
the
Gentiles
and
when
James
Cephas
and
John
who
seemed
to
be
pillars
perceived
the
grace
that
had
been
given
to
me
they
gave
me
and
Barnabas
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
that
we
should
go
to
the
Gentiles
and
they
to
the
circumcised
They
desired
only
that
we
should
remember
the
poor
the
very
thing
which
I
also
was
eager
to
do
No
Return
to
the
Law
Now
when
Peter
had
come
to
Antioch
I
withstood
him
to
his
face
because
he
was
to
be
blamed
for
before
certain
men
came
from
James
he
would
eat
with
the
Gentiles
but
when
they
came
he
withdrew
and
separated
himself
fearing
those
who
were
of
the
circumcision
And
the
rest
of
the
Jews
also
played
the
hypocrite
with
him
so
that
even
Barnabas
was
carried
away
with
their
hypocrisy
But
when
I
saw
that
they
were
not
straightforward
about
the
truth
of
the
gospel
I
said
to
Peter
before
them
all
If
you
being
a
Jew
live
in
the
manner
of
Gentiles
and
not
as
the
Jews
why
do
you
compel
Gentiles
to
live
as
We
who
are
Jews
by
nature
and
not
sinners
of
the
Gentiles
knowing
that
a
man
is
not
justified
by
the
works
of
the
law
but
by
faith
in
Jesus
Christ
even
we
have
believed
in
Christ
Jesus
that
we
might
be
justified
by
faith
in
Christ
and
not
by
the
works
of
the
law
for
by
the
works
of
the
law
no
flesh
shall
be
justified
But
if
while
we
seek
to
be
justified
by
Christ
we
ourselves
also
are
found
sinners
is
Christ
therefore
a
minister
of
sin
Certainly
not
For
if
I
build
again
those
things
which
I
destroyed
I
make
myself
a
transgressor
For
I
through
the
law
died
to
the
law
that
I
might
live
to
God
I
have
been
crucified
with
Christ
it
is
no
longer
I
who
live
but
Christ
lives
in
me
and
the
life
which
I
now
live
in
the
flesh
I
live
by
faith
in
the
Son
of
God
who
loved
me
and
gave
Himself
for
me
I
do
not
set
aside
the
grace
of
God
for
if
righteousness
comes
through
the
law
then
Christ
died
in
vainO
foolish
Galatians
Who
has
bewitched
you
that
you
should
not
obey
the
truth
before
whose
eyes
Jesus
Christ
was
clearly
portrayed
among
you
as
crucified
This
only
I
want
to
learn
from
you
Did
you
receive
the
Spirit
by
the
works
of
the
law
or
by
the
hearing
of
faith
Are
you
so
foolish
Having
begun
in
the
Spirit
are
you
now
being
made
perfect
by
the
flesh
Have
you
suffered
so
many
things
in
vainif
indeed
it
was
in
vain
Therefore
He
who
supplies
the
Spirit
to
you
and
works
miracles
among
you
does
He
do
it
by
the
works
of
the
law
or
by
the
hearing
of
faith
just
as
Abraham
believed
God
and
it
was
accounted
to
him
for
righteousness
Therefore
know
that
only
those
who
are
of
faith
are
sons
of
Abraham
And
the
Scripture
foreseeing
that
God
would
justify
the
Gentiles
by
faith
preached
the
gospel
to
Abraham
beforehand
saying
In
you
all
the
nations
shall
be
blessed
So
then
those
who
are
of
faith
are
blessed
with
believing
Abraham
The
Law
Brings
a
Curse
For
as
many
as
are
of
the
works
of
the
law
are
under
the
curse
for
it
is
written
Cursed
is
everyone
who
does
not
continue
in
all
things
which
are
written
in
the
book
of
the
law
to
do
them
But
that
no
one
is
justified
by
the
law
in
the
sight
of
God
is
evident
for
the
just
shall
live
by
faith
Yet
the
law
is
not
of
faith
but
the
man
who
does
them
shall
live
by
them
Christ
has
redeemed
us
from
the
curse
of
the
law
having
become
a
curse
for
us
it
is
written
Cursed
is
everyone
who
hangs
on
a
tree
that
the
blessing
of
Abraham
might
come
upon
the
Gentiles
in
Christ
Jesus
that
we
might
receive
the
promise
of
the
Spirit
through
faith
The
Changeless
Promise
Gen
– 
Brethren
I
speak
in
the
manner
of
men
Though
it
is
only
a
mans
covenant
yet
if
it
is
confirmed
no
one
annuls
or
adds
to
it
Now
to
Abraham
and
his
Seed
were
the
promises
made
He
does
not
say
And
to
seeds
as
of
many
but
as
of
one
And
to
your
Seed
who
is
Christ
And
this
I
say
that
the
law
which
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
years
later
cannot
annul
the
covenant
that
was
confirmed
before
by
God
in
Christ
that
it
should
make
the
promise
of
no
effect
For
if
the
inheritance
is
of
the
law
it
is
no
longer
of
promise
but
God
gave
it
to
Abraham
by
promise
Purpose
of
the
Law
What
purpose
then
does
the
law
serve
It
was
added
because
of
transgressions
till
the
Seed
should
come
to
whom
the
promise
was
made
and
it
was
appointed
through
angels
by
the
hand
of
a
mediator
Now
a
mediator
does
not
mediate
for
one
only
but
God
is
one
Is
the
law
then
against
the
promises
of
God
Certainly
not
For
if
there
had
been
a
law
given
which
could
have
given
life
truly
righteousness
would
have
been
by
the
law
But
the
Scripture
has
confined
all
under
sin
that
the
promise
by
faith
in
Jesus
Christ
might
be
given
to
those
who
believe
But
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
under
guard
by
the
law
kept
for
the
faith
which
would
afterward
be
revealed
Therefore
the
law
was
our
tutor
to
bring
us
to
Christ
that
we
might
be
justified
by
faith
But
after
faith
has
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
Sons
and
Heirs
For
you
are
all
sons
of
God
through
faith
in
Christ
Jesus
For
as
many
of
you
as
were
baptized
into
Christ
have
put
on
Christ
There
is
neither
Jew
nor
Greek
there
is
neither
slave
nor
free
there
is
neither
male
nor
female
for
you
are
all
one
in
Christ
Jesus
And
if
you
are
Christs
then
you
are
Abrahams
seed
and
heirs
according
to
the
promiseNow
I
say
that
the
heir
as
long
as
he
is
a
child
does
not
differ
at
all
from
a
slave
though
he
is
master
of
all
but
is
under
guardians
and
stewards
until
the
time
appointed
by
the
father
Even
so
we
when
we
were
children
were
in
bondage
under
the
elements
of
the
world
But
when
the
fullness
of
the
time
had
come
God
sent
forth
His
Son
born
of
a
woman
born
under
the
law
to
redeem
those
who
were
under
the
law
that
we
might
receive
the
adoption
as
sons
And
because
you
are
sons
God
has
sent
forth
the
Spirit
of
His
Son
into
your
hearts
crying
out
Abba
Father
Therefore
you
are
no
longer
a
slave
but
a
son
and
if
a
son
then
an
heir
of
God
through
Christ
Fears
for
the
Church
But
then
indeed
when
you
did
not
know
God
you
served
those
which
by
nature
are
not
gods
But
now
after
you
have
known
God
or
rather
are
known
by
God
how
is
it
that
you
turn
again
to
the
weak
and
beggarly
elements
to
which
you
desire
again
to
be
in
bondage
You
observe
days
and
months
and
seasons
and
years
I
am
afraid
for
you
lest
I
have
labored
for
you
in
vain
Brethren
I
urge
you
to
become
like
me
for
I
became
like
you
You
have
not
injured
me
at
all
You
know
that
because
of
physical
infirmity
I
preached
the
gospel
to
you
at
the
first
And
my
trial
which
was
in
my
flesh
you
did
not
despise
or
reject
but
you
received
me
as
an
angel
of
God
even
as
Christ
Jesus
What
then
was
the
blessing
you
enjoyed
For
I
bear
you
witness
that
if
possible
you
would
have
plucked
out
your
own
eyes
and
given
them
to
me
Have
I
therefore
become
your
enemy
because
I
tell
you
the
truth
They
zealously
court
you
but
for
no
good
yes
they
want
to
exclude
you
that
you
may
be
zealous
for
them
But
it
is
good
to
be
zealous
in
a
good
thing
always
and
not
only
when
I
am
present
with
you
My
little
children
for
whom
I
labor
in
birth
again
until
Christ
is
formed
in
you
I
would
like
to
be
present
with
you
now
and
to
change
my
tone
for
I
have
doubts
about
you
Two
Covenants
–
Is
 
Tell
me
you
who
desire
to
be
under
the
law
do
you
not
hear
the
law
For
it
is
written
that
Abraham
had
two
sons
the
one
by
a
bondwoman
the
other
by
a
freewoman
But
he
who
was
of
the
bondwoman
was
born
according
to
the
flesh
and
he
of
the
freewoman
through
promise
which
things
are
symbolic
For
these
are
the
two
covenants
the
one
from
Mount
Sinai
which
gives
birth
to
bondage
which
is
Hagar
for
this
Hagar
is
Mount
Sinai
in
Arabia
and
corresponds
to
Jerusalem
which
now
is
and
is
in
bondage
with
her
children
but
the
Jerusalem
above
is
free
which
is
the
mother
of
us
all
For
it
is
written
​
​​Rejoice
O
barren
​​You
who
do
not
bear
​​Break
forth
and
shout
​​You
who
are
not
in
labor
​​For
the
desolate
has
many
more
children
​​Than
she
who
has
a
husband
​
Now
we
brethren
as
Isaac
was
are
children
of
promise
But
as
he
who
was
born
according
to
the
flesh
then
persecuted
him
who
was
born
according
to
the
Spirit
even
so
it
is
now
Nevertheless
what
does
the
Scripture
say
Cast
out
the
bondwoman
and
her
son
for
the
son
of
the
bondwoman
shall
not
be
heir
with
the
son
of
the
freewoman
So
then
brethren
we
are
not
children
of
the
bondwoman
but
of
the
freeStand
fast
therefore
in
the
liberty
by
which
Christ
has
made
us
free
and
do
not
be
entangled
again
with
a
yoke
of
bondage
Indeed
I
Paul
say
to
you
that
if
you
become
circumcised
Christ
will
profit
you
nothing
And
I
testify
again
to
every
man
who
becomes
circumcised
that
he
is
a
debtor
to
keep
the
whole
law
You
have
become
estranged
from
Christ
you
who
attempt
to
be
justified
by
law
you
have
fallen
from
grace
For
we
through
the
Spirit
eagerly
wait
for
the
hope
of
righteousness
by
faith
For
in
Christ
Jesus
neither
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
avails
anything
but
faith
working
through
love
Love
Fulfills
the
Law
You
ran
well
Who
hindered
you
from
obeying
the
truth
This
persuasion
does
not
come
from
Him
who
calls
you
A
little
leaven
leavens
the
whole
lump
I
have
confidence
in
you
in
the
Lord
that
you
will
have
no
other
mind
but
he
who
troubles
you
shall
bear
his
judgment
whoever
he
is
And
I
brethren
if
I
still
preach
circumcision
why
do
I
still
suffer
persecution
Then
the
offense
of
the
cross
has
ceased
I
could
wish
that
those
who
trouble
you
would
even
cut
themselves
off
For
you
brethren
have
been
called
to
liberty
only
do
not
use
liberty
as
an
opportunity
for
the
flesh
but
through
love
serve
one
another
For
all
the
law
is
fulfilled
in
one
word
even
in
this
You
shall
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
But
if
you
bite
and
devour
one
another
beware
lest
you
be
consumed
by
one
another
Walking
in
the
Spirit
I
say
then
Walk
in
the
Spirit
and
you
shall
not
fulfill
the
lust
of
the
flesh
For
the
flesh
lusts
against
the
Spirit
and
the
Spirit
against
the
flesh
and
these
are
contrary
to
one
another
so
that
you
do
not
do
the
things
that
you
wish
But
if
you
are
led
by
the
Spirit
you
are
not
under
the
law
Now
the
works
of
the
flesh
are
evident
which
are
adultery
fornication
uncleanness
lewdness
idolatry
sorcery
hatred
contentions
jealousies
outbursts
of
wrath
selfish
ambitions
dissensions
heresies
envy
murders
drunkenness
revelries
and
the
like
of
which
I
tell
you
beforehand
just
as
I
also
told
you
in
time
past
that
those
who
practice
such
things
will
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
God
But
the
fruit
of
the
Spirit
is
love
joy
peace
longsuffering
kindness
goodness
faithfulness
gentleness
Against
such
there
is
no
law
And
those
who
are
have
crucified
the
flesh
with
its
passions
and
desires
If
we
live
in
the
Spirit
let
us
also
walk
in
the
Spirit
Let
us
not
become
conceited
provoking
one
another
envying
one
another
Brethren
if
a
man
is
overtaken
in
any
trespass
you
who
are
spiritual
restore
such
a
one
in
a
spirit
of
gentleness
considering
yourself
lest
you
also
be
tempted
Bear
one
anothers
burdens
and
so
fulfill
the
law
of
Christ
For
if
anyone
thinks
himself
to
be
something
when
he
is
nothing
he
deceives
himself
But
let
each
one
examine
his
own
work
and
then
he
will
have
rejoicing
in
himself
alone
and
not
in
another
For
each
one
shall
bear
his
own
load
Be
Generous
and
Do
Good
Let
him
who
is
taught
the
word
share
in
all
good
things
with
him
who
teaches
Do
not
be
deceived
God
is
not
mocked
for
whatever
a
man
sows
that
he
will
also
reap
For
he
who
sows
to
his
flesh
will
of
the
flesh
reap
corruption
but
he
who
sows
to
the
Spirit
will
of
the
Spirit
reap
everlasting
life
And
let
us
not
grow
weary
while
doing
good
for
in
due
season
we
shall
reap
if
we
do
not
lose
heart
Therefore
as
we
have
opportunity
let
us
do
good
to
all
especially
to
those
who
are
of
the
household
of
faith
Glory
Only
in
the
Cross
See
with
what
large
letters
I
have
written
to
you
with
my
own
hand
As
many
as
desire
to
make
a
good
showing
in
the
flesh
these
would
compel
you
to
be
circumcised
only
that
they
may
not
suffer
persecution
for
the
cross
of
Christ
For
not
even
those
who
are
circumcised
keep
the
law
but
they
desire
to
have
you
circumcised
that
they
may
boast
in
your
flesh
But
God
forbid
that
I
should
boast
except
in
the
cross
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
by
whom
the
world
has
been
crucified
to
me
and
I
to
the
world
For
in
Christ
Jesus
neither
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
avails
anything
but
a
new
creation
Blessing
and
a
Plea
And
as
many
as
walk
according
to
this
rule
peace
and
mercy
be
upon
them
and
upon
the
Israel
of
God
From
now
on
let
no
one
trouble
me
for
I
bear
in
my
body
the
marks
of
the
Lord
Jesus
Brethren
the
grace
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
be
with
your
spirit

to
you
and
peace
from
God
our
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
Redemption
in
Christ
Blessed
be
the
God
and
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
who
has
blessed
us
with
every
spiritual
blessing
in
the
heavenly
places
in
Christ
just
as
He
chose
us
in
Him
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
that
we
should
be
holy
and
without
blame
before
Him
in
love
having
predestined
us
to
adoption
as
sons
by
Jesus
Christ
to
Himself
according
to
the
good
pleasure
of
His
will
to
the
praise
of
the
glory
of
His
grace
by
which
He
made
us
accepted
in
the
Beloved
In
Him
we
have
redemption
through
His
blood
the
forgiveness
of
sins
according
to
the
riches
of
His
grace
which
He
made
to
abound
toward
us
in
all
wisdom
and
prudence
having
made
known
to
us
the
mystery
of
His
will
according
to
His
good
pleasure
which
He
purposed
in
Himself
that
in
the
dispensation
of
the
fullness
of
the
times
He
might
gather
together
in
one
all
things
in
Christ
both
which
are
in
heaven
and
which
are
on
earthin
Him
In
Him
also
we
have
obtained
an
inheritance
being
predestined
according
to
the
purpose
of
Him
who
works
all
things
according
to
the
counsel
of
His
will
that
we
who
first
trusted
in
Christ
should
be
to
the
praise
of
His
glory
In
Him
you
also
trusted
after
you
heard
the
word
of
truth
the
gospel
of
your
salvation
in
whom
also
having
believed
you
were
sealed
with
the
Holy
Spirit
of
promise
who
is
the
guarantee
of
our
inheritance
until
the
redemption
of
the
purchased
possession
to
the
praise
of
His
glory
Prayer
for
Spiritual
Wisdom
Therefore
I
also
after
I
heard
of
your
faith
in
the
Lord
Jesus
and
your
love
for
all
the
saints
do
not
cease
to
give
thanks
for
you
making
mention
of
you
in
my
prayers
that
the
God
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
the
Father
of
glory
may
give
to
you
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
revelation
in
the
knowledge
of
Him
the
eyes
of
your
understanding
being
enlightened
that
you
may
know
what
is
the
hope
of
His
calling
what
are
the
riches
of
the
glory
of
His
inheritance
in
the
saints
and
what
is
the
exceeding
greatness
of
His
power
toward
us
who
believe
according
to
the
working
of
His
mighty
power
which
He
worked
in
Christ
when
He
raised
Him
from
the
dead
and
seated
Him
at
His
right
hand
in
the
heavenly
places
far
above
all
principality
and
power
and
might
and
dominion
and
every
name
that
is
named
not
only
in
this
age
but
also
in
that
which
is
to
come
And
He
put
all
things
under
His
feet
and
gave
Him
to
be
head
over
all
things
to
the
church
which
is
His
body
the
fullness
of
Him
who
fills
all
in
all
And
you
He
made
alive
who
were
dead
in
trespasses
and
sins
in
which
you
once
walked
according
to
the
course
of
this
world
according
to
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
the
spirit
who
now
works
in
the
sons
of
disobedience
among
whom
also
we
all
once
conducted
ourselves
in
the
lusts
of
our
flesh
fulfilling
the
desires
of
the
flesh
and
of
the
mind
and
were
by
nature
children
of
wrath
just
as
the
others
But
God
who
is
rich
in
mercy
because
of
His
great
love
with
which
He
loved
us
even
when
we
were
dead
in
trespasses
made
us
alive
together
with
Christ
grace
you
have
been
saved
and
raised
us
up
together
and
made
us
sit
together
in
the
heavenly
places
in
Christ
Jesus
that
in
the
ages
to
come
He
might
show
the
exceeding
riches
of
His
grace
in
His
kindness
toward
us
in
Christ
Jesus
For
by
grace
you
have
been
saved
through
faith
and
that
not
of
yourselves
it
is
the
gift
of
God
not
of
works
lest
anyone
should
boast
For
we
are
His
workmanship
created
in
Christ
Jesus
for
good
works
which
God
prepared
beforehand
that
we
should
walk
in
them
Brought
Near
by
His
Blood
Therefore
remember
that
you
once
Gentiles
in
the
fleshwho
are
called
Uncircumcision
by
what
is
called
the
Circumcision
made
in
the
flesh
by
hands
that
at
that
time
you
were
without
Christ
being
aliens
from
the
commonwealth
of
Israel
and
strangers
from
the
covenants
of
promise
having
no
hope
and
without
God
in
the
world
But
now
in
Christ
Jesus
you
who
once
were
far
off
have
been
brought
near
by
the
blood
of
Christ
Christ
Our
Peace
For
He
Himself
is
our
peace
who
has
made
both
one
and
has
broken
down
the
middle
wall
of
separation
having
abolished
in
His
flesh
the
enmity
that
is
the
law
of
commandments
contained
in
ordinances
so
as
to
create
in
Himself
one
new
man
from
the
two
thus
making
peace
and
that
He
might
reconcile
them
both
to
God
in
one
body
through
the
cross
thereby
putting
to
death
the
enmity
And
He
came
and
preached
peace
to
you
who
were
afar
off
and
to
those
who
were
near
For
through
Him
we
both
have
access
by
one
Spirit
to
the
Father
Christ
Our
Cornerstone
Now
therefore
you
are
no
longer
strangers
and
foreigners
but
fellow
citizens
with
the
saints
and
members
of
the
household
of
God
having
been
built
on
the
foundation
of
the
apostles
and
prophets
Jesus
Christ
Himself
being
the
chief
cornerstone
in
whom
the
whole
building
being
fitted
together
grows
into
a
holy
temple
in
the
Lord
in
whom
you
also
are
being
built
together
for
a
dwelling
place
of
God
in
the
SpiritThe
Mystery
Revealed
For
this
reason
I
Paul
the
prisoner
of
Christ
Jesus
for
you
Gentiles
if
indeed
you
have
heard
of
the
dispensation
of
the
grace
of
God
which
was
given
to
me
for
you
how
that
by
revelation
He
made
known
to
me
the
mystery
I
have
briefly
written
already
by
which
when
you
read
you
may
understand
my
knowledge
in
the
mystery
of
Christ
which
in
other
ages
was
not
made
known
to
the
sons
of
men
as
it
has
now
been
revealed
by
the
Spirit
to
His
holy
apostles
and
prophets
that
the
Gentiles
should
be
fellow
heirs
of
the
same
body
and
partakers
of
His
promise
in
Christ
through
the
gospel
of
which
I
became
a
minister
according
to
the
gift
of
the
grace
of
God
given
to
me
by
the
effective
working
of
His
power
Purpose
of
the
Mystery
To
me
who
am
less
than
the
least
of
all
the
saints
this
grace
was
given
that
I
should
preach
among
the
Gentiles
the
unsearchable
riches
of
Christ
and
to
make
all
see
what
is
the
fellowship
of
the
mystery
which
from
the
beginning
of
the
ages
has
been
hidden
in
God
who
created
all
things
through
Jesus
Christ
to
the
intent
that
now
the
manifold
wisdom
of
God
might
be
made
known
by
the
church
to
the
principalities
and
powers
in
the
heavenly
places
according
to
the
eternal
purpose
which
He
accomplished
in
Christ
Jesus
our
Lord
in
whom
we
have
boldness
and
access
with
confidence
through
faith
in
Him
Therefore
I
ask
that
you
do
not
lose
heart
at
my
tribulations
for
you
which
is
your
glory
Appreciation
of
the
Mystery
For
this
reason
I
bow
my
knees
to
the
Father
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
from
whom
the
whole
family
in
heaven
and
earth
is
named
that
He
would
grant
you
according
to
the
riches
of
His
glory
to
be
strengthened
with
might
through
His
Spirit
in
the
inner
man
that
Christ
may
dwell
in
your
hearts
through
faith
that
you
being
rooted
and
grounded
in
love
may
be
able
to
comprehend
with
all
the
saints
what
is
the
width
and
length
and
depth
and
height
to
know
the
love
of
Christ
which
passes
knowledge
that
you
may
be
filled
with
all
the
fullness
of
God
Now
to
Him
who
is
able
to
do
exceedingly
abundantly
above
all
that
we
ask
or
think
according
to
the
power
that
works
in
us
to
Him
be
glory
in
the
church
by
Christ
Jesus
to
all
generations
forever
and
ever
AmenWalk
in
Unity
I
therefore
the
prisoner
of
the
Lord
beseech
you
to
walk
worthy
of
the
calling
with
which
you
were
called
with
all
lowliness
and
gentleness
with
longsuffering
bearing
with
one
another
in
love
endeavoring
to
keep
the
unity
of
the
Spirit
in
the
bond
of
peace
There
is
one
body
and
one
Spirit
just
as
you
were
called
in
one
hope
of
your
calling
one
Lord
one
faith
one
baptism
one
God
and
Father
of
all
who
is
above
all
and
through
all
and
in
you
all
Spiritual
Gifts
But
to
each
one
of
us
grace
was
given
according
to
the
measure
of
Christs
gift
Therefore
He
says
​​When
He
ascended
on
high
​​He
led
captivity
captive
​​And
gave
gifts
to
men
this
He
ascended
what
does
it
mean
but
that
He
also
first
descended
into
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth
He
who
descended
is
also
the
One
who
ascended
far
above
all
the
heavens
that
He
might
fill
all
things
And
He
Himself
gave
some
to
be
apostles
some
prophets
some
evangelists
and
some
pastors
and
teachers
for
the
equipping
of
the
saints
for
the
work
of
ministry
for
the
edifying
of
the
body
of
Christ
till
we
all
come
to
the
unity
of
the
faith
and
of
the
knowledge
of
the
Son
of
God
to
a
perfect
man
to
the
measure
of
the
stature
of
the
fullness
of
Christ
that
we
should
no
longer
be
children
tossed
to
and
fro
and
carried
about
with
every
wind
of
doctrine
by
the
trickery
of
men
in
the
cunning
craftiness
of
deceitful
plotting
but
speaking
the
truth
in
love
may
grow
up
in
all
things
into
Him
who
is
the
headChrist
from
whom
the
whole
body
joined
and
knit
together
by
what
every
joint
supplies
according
to
the
effective
working
by
which
every
part
does
its
share
causes
growth
of
the
body
for
the
edifying
of
itself
in
love
The
New
Man
This
I
say
therefore
and
testify
in
the
Lord
that
you
should
no
longer
walk
as
the
rest
of
the
Gentiles
walk
in
the
futility
of
their
mind
having
their
understanding
darkened
being
alienated
from
the
life
of
God
because
of
the
ignorance
that
is
in
them
because
of
the
blindness
of
their
heart
who
being
past
feeling
have
given
themselves
over
to
lewdness
to
work
all
uncleanness
with
greediness
But
you
have
not
so
learned
Christ
if
indeed
you
have
heard
Him
and
have
been
taught
by
Him
as
the
truth
is
in
Jesus
that
you
put
off
concerning
your
former
conduct
the
old
man
which
grows
corrupt
according
to
the
deceitful
lusts
and
be
renewed
in
the
spirit
of
your
mind
and
that
you
put
on
the
new
man
which
was
created
according
to
God
in
true
righteousness
and
holiness
Do
Not
Grieve
the
Spirit
Therefore
putting
away
lying
Let
each
one
of
you
speak
truth
with
his
neighbor
for
we
are
members
of
one
another
Be
angry
and
do
not
sin
do
not
let
the
sun
go
down
on
your
wrath
nor
give
place
to
the
devil
Let
him
who
stole
steal
no
longer
but
rather
let
him
labor
working
with
his
hands
what
is
good
that
he
may
have
something
to
give
him
who
has
need
Let
no
corrupt
word
proceed
out
of
your
mouth
but
what
is
good
for
necessary
edification
that
it
may
impart
grace
to
the
hearers
And
do
not
grieve
the
Holy
Spirit
of
God
by
whom
you
were
sealed
for
the
day
of
redemption
Let
all
bitterness
wrath
anger
clamor
and
evil
speaking
be
put
away
from
you
with
all
malice
And
be
kind
to
one
another
tenderhearted
forgiving
one
another
even
as
God
in
Christ
forgave
youWalk
in
Love
Therefore
be
imitators
of
God
as
dear
children
And
walk
in
love
as
Christ
also
has
loved
us
and
given
Himself
for
us
an
offering
and
a
sacrifice
to
God
for
a
aroma
But
fornication
and
all
uncleanness
or
covetousness
let
it
not
even
be
named
among
you
as
is
fitting
for
saints
neither
filthiness
nor
foolish
talking
nor
coarse
jesting
which
are
not
fitting
but
rather
giving
of
thanks
For
this
you
know
that
no
fornicator
unclean
person
nor
covetous
man
who
is
an
idolater
has
any
inheritance
in
the
kingdom
of
Christ
and
God
Let
no
one
deceive
you
with
empty
words
for
because
of
these
things
the
wrath
of
God
comes
upon
the
sons
of
disobedience
Therefore
do
not
be
partakers
with
them
Walk
in
Light
For
you
were
once
darkness
but
now
you
are
light
in
the
Lord
Walk
as
children
of
light
the
fruit
of
the
Spirit
is
in
all
goodness
righteousness
and
truth
finding
out
what
is
acceptable
to
the
Lord
And
have
no
fellowship
with
the
unfruitful
works
of
darkness
but
rather
expose
them
For
it
is
shameful
even
to
speak
of
those
things
which
are
done
by
them
in
secret
But
all
things
that
are
exposed
are
made
manifest
by
the
light
for
whatever
makes
manifest
is
light
Therefore
He
says
​
​​Awake
you
who
sleep
​​Arise
from
the
dead
​​And
Christ
will
give
you
light
Walk
in
Wisdom
See
then
that
you
walk
circumspectly
not
as
fools
but
as
wise
redeeming
the
time
because
the
days
are
evil
Therefore
do
not
be
unwise
but
understand
what
the
will
of
the
Lord
is
And
do
not
be
drunk
with
wine
in
which
is
dissipation
but
be
filled
with
the
Spirit
speaking
to
one
another
in
psalms
and
hymns
and
spiritual
songs
singing
and
making
melody
in
your
heart
to
the
Lord
giving
thanks
always
for
all
things
to
God
the
Father
in
the
name
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
submitting
to
one
another
in
the
fear
of
God
MarriageChrist
and
the
Church
Col

 
Wives
submit
to
your
own
husbands
as
to
the
Lord
For
the
husband
is
head
of
the
wife
as
also
Christ
is
head
of
the
church
and
He
is
the
Savior
of
the
body
Therefore
just
as
the
church
is
subject
to
Christ
so
let
the
wives
be
to
their
own
husbands
in
everything
Husbands
love
your
wives
just
as
Christ
also
loved
the
church
and
gave
Himself
for
her
that
He
might
sanctify
and
cleanse
her
with
the
washing
of
water
by
the
word
that
He
might
present
her
to
Himself
a
glorious
church
not
having
spot
or
wrinkle
or
any
such
thing
but
that
she
should
be
holy
and
without
blemish
So
husbands
ought
to
love
their
own
wives
as
their
own
bodies
he
who
loves
his
wife
loves
himself
For
no
one
ever
hated
his
own
flesh
but
nourishes
and
cherishes
it
just
as
the
Lord
does
the
church
For
we
are
members
of
His
body
of
His
flesh
and
of
His
bones
For
this
reason
a
man
shall
leave
his
father
and
mother
and
be
joined
to
his
wife
and
the
two
shall
become
one
This
is
a
great
mystery
but
I
speak
concerning
Christ
and
the
church
Nevertheless
let
each
one
of
you
in
particular
so
love
his
own
wife
as
himself
and
let
the
wife
see
that
she
respects
her
husband
Children
and
Parents
Deut
obey
your
parents
in
the
Lord
for
this
is
right
Honor
your
father
and
mother
which
is
the
first
commandment
with
promise
that
it
may
be
well
with
you
and
you
may
live
long
on
the
earth
And
you
fathers
do
not
provoke
your
children
to
wrath
but
bring
them
up
in
the
training
and
admonition
of
the
Lord
Bondservants
and
Masters
Bondservants
be
obedient
to
those
who
are
your
masters
according
to
the
flesh
with
fear
and
trembling
in
sincerity
of
heart
as
to
Christ
not
with
eyeservice
as
but
as
bondservants
of
Christ
doing
the
will
of
God
from
the
heart
with
goodwill
doing
service
as
to
the
Lord
and
not
to
men
knowing
that
whatever
good
anyone
does
he
will
receive
the
same
from
the
Lord
whether
he
is
a
slave
or
free
And
you
masters
do
the
same
things
to
them
giving
up
threatening
knowing
that
your
own
Master
also
is
in
heaven
and
there
is
no
partiality
with
Him
The
Whole
Armor
of
God
Finally
my
brethren
be
strong
in
the
Lord
and
in
the
power
of
His
might
Put
on
the
whole
armor
of
God
that
you
may
be
able
to
stand
against
the
wiles
of
the
devil
For
we
do
not
wrestle
against
flesh
and
blood
but
against
principalities
against
powers
against
the
rulers
of
the
darkness
of
this
age
against
spiritual
hosts
of
wickedness
in
the
heavenly
places
Therefore
take
up
the
whole
armor
of
God
that
you
may
be
able
to
withstand
in
the
evil
day
and
having
done
all
to
stand
Stand
therefore
having
girded
your
waist
with
truth
having
put
on
the
breastplate
of
righteousness
and
having
shod
your
feet
with
the
preparation
of
the
gospel
of
peace
above
all
taking
the
shield
of
faith
with
which
you
will
be
able
to
quench
all
the
fiery
darts
of
the
wicked
one
And
take
the
helmet
of
salvation
and
the
sword
of
the
Spirit
which
is
the
word
of
God
praying
always
with
all
prayer
and
supplication
in
the
Spirit
being
watchful
to
this
end
with
all
perseverance
and
supplication
for
all
the
saints
and
for
me
that
utterance
may
be
given
to
me
that
I
may
open
my
mouth
boldly
to
make
known
the
mystery
of
the
gospel
for
which
I
am
an
ambassador
in
chains
that
in
it
I
may
speak
boldly
as
I
ought
to
speak
A
Gracious
Greeting
But
that
you
also
may
know
my
affairs
and
how
I
am
doing
Tychicus
a
beloved
brother
and
faithful
minister
in
the
Lord
will
make
all
things
known
to
you
whom
I
have
sent
to
you
for
this
very
purpose
that
you
may
know
our
affairs
and
that
he
may
comfort
your
hearts
Peace
to
the
brethren
and
love
with
faith
from
God
the
Father
and
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
Grace
be
with
all
those
who
love
our
Lord
